# master-degree-thesis-latex-src
Pretty barebones repository that contains the LaTeX source for my Master Degree's thesis. 

This **LaTeX** project can be compiled using **texlive** and [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) extension's 
default "Build" job within Visual Studio Code.

~~A downloadable PDF file will be provided in a later moment~~. [There you go](thesis.pdf).
